	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity basically defines in how much time we required solved 
	this problem. As a programmer, its our responsiblity 
		to run the program in less time and makes our program
		efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> defines how much space is occupied 
		to solve this problem. If our program have n elements we must have to solve the question in O(n)</p>
