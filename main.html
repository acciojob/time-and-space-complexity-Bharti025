	<h1>Time,Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity basically defines in how much time we solved 
	this problem.There are three types of time complexity 1. Worst case Time Complexity 2. Base Case Time Complexity
	3.Average Case Time Complexity.We used most efficient time complexity. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> defines how much space is used to solve this problem.It is denoted by O(n).</p>
